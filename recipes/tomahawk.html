        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/2 pound tomahawk rib eye steak</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Step 1</strong></dt>
            <dd>Remove steak from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature
                30 minutes to an hour before cooking.</dd> <br>
            <dt><strong>Step 2</strong></dt>
            <dd>Preheat the grill to medium-high, 400 to 450 degrees F(200 to 230 degrees C).
                Sprinkle steak evenly and liberally on all sides with salt and black pepper.</dd> <br>
            <dt><strong>Step 3</strong></dt>
            <dd>Lightly coat grill grates with oil or grilling spray. Place steak on hot grates, 
                and grill, undisturbed, until it releases easily from the grates, about 4 minutes.
                Flip, and repeat on the other side. Continue grilling, turning occasionally, until 
                a thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of steak registers 125 degrees 
                F (52 degrees C), 30 to 40 minutes.</dd><br>
            <dt><strong>Step 4</strong></dt>
            <dd>Transfer steak to a cutting board; let rest 15 minutes. Run a knife along the inside
                edge of the bone to remove steak from the bone in 1 piece; slice against the grain to serve.</dd><br>
